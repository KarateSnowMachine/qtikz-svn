The following Ubuntu packages are required for compilation
(not counting an ordinary C++ development environment and a
standard LaTeX environment)
qt4-dev-tools
libqt4-dev
libpoppler-qt-dev
libpoppler-qt4-dev
pgf
preview-latex-style

Edit the paths in conf.pri
Create the translation files:
  lrelease src/src.pro
Run the following commands in the main directory:
  qmake
  make
  make translations (if you want to install the translations)
  make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the file conf.pri before running make.

Make sure to make the changes in conf.pri before running make and
make also sure to run "lrelease src.pro" in the src directory or
alternatively run "make translations" in the main directory, otherwise
the translation files will not be installed correctly.
