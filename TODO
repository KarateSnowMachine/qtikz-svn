- In multiple image mode, allow to save and export only the current image
  (use KFileDialog(url, filter, parent, widget) where widget is a checkbox).
  This is already the case for all exports except "Export to PDF" because
  that's the only thing that works.
- Clicking an item in the TikZ commands dock widget should not insert
  it, but only select it.  Pressing an Insert button would then do the
  actual insertion.  There should also be a Help button which opens the
  TikZ manual at the page where the selected item is explained.
- Make a graphical tool for editing the XML file containing the TikZ
  commands similar to keditbookmarks
- Create a new process for each window opened by the "New" action.
- Download files which are \included or \inputted in remote template files
  or remote pgf files to the temporary directory (could be dangerous when
  the user is still editing the \input command).
- Complete tikzcommands.xml:

  The following sections of the TikZ manual are implemented:
  Section 13 complete (except \pgfextra)
  Section 14 almost complete (except preaction=<options>, postaction=<options>,
    decorate, decoration=<zigzag/...>)
  Section 15 partially
