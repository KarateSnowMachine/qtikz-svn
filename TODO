Features:
---------

- In multiple image mode, allow to save and export only the current image
  (use KFileDialog(url, filter, parent, widget) where widget is a checkbox).
  This is already the case for all exports except "Export to PDF" because
  that's the only thing that works.

- Complete tikzcommands.xml (only add commands from Part III):

  The following sections of the TikZ manual v2.10 are implemented:
  Section 13 almost complete (except 13.2.2, 13.2.4, 13.2.5 (maybe this is too
    advanced), 13.3, current point is local)
  Section 14 almost complete (except insert path, append after command,
    prefix after command, svg, \pgfextra)
  Section 15 almost complete (except double equal sign distance, 15.5, 15.7,
    preaction=<options>, postaction=<options>,
    decorate, decoration=<zigzag/...>)
  Section 16 partially (except alias, shape border uses incircle, shape border
    rotate, 16.3, node halign header, 16.5.3, 16.6, transform shape, 16.10,
    16.13, 16.14)
  Section 17 complete (except between origins, between borders)
  Section 18
  Section 19
  Section 20
  Section 21
  Section 22

- Clicking an item in the TikZ commands dock widget should not insert
  it, but only select it.  Pressing an Insert button would then do the
  actual insertion.  There should also be a Help button which opens the
  TikZ manual at the page where the selected item is explained.

- Make a graphical tool for editing the XML file containing the TikZ
  commands similar to keditbookmarks

- Create a new process for each window opened by the "New" action.
  Is that really necessary?

- Download files which are \included or \inputted in remote template files
  or remote pgf files to the temporary directory (could be dangerous when
  the user is still editing the \input command).
  No, don't do that, find a better way to handle this.

Bugs or shortcomings:
---------------------

- In common/utils/standardaction.cpp a better way of promoting the KActions
  to Action must be found.

- In common/tikzpreviewcontroller.cpp find a better way to print the image.

- If common/utils/file.cpp is going to be used more generally, then it should
  create s_tempDir itself instead of relying that it is already been done
  elsewhere in the program.
