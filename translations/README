This file contains notes for developers and translators of qtikz/ktikz.

Adding a new language:
----------------------

Assume that ktikz is not yet translated to Brazilian Portuguese and you want
to add translations for this language.  Then you must copy an already existing
language directory in the translations directory (with its contents) to pt_BR,
e.g. if you are in the main directory, then you enter:
  cp -r translations/fr translations/pt_BR
The file translations/pt_BR/qtikz_<oldlanguagecode>.ts must be renamed to
translations/pt_BR/qtikz_pt_BR.ts:
  mv translations/pt_BR/qtikz_fr.ts translations/pt_BR/qtikz_pt_BR.ts
After this you have to edit translations/translations.pri, search for the line
  TRANSLATIONS = cs de es fr ...
and add pt_BR to it, so that the line looks like
  TRANSLATIONS = cs de es fr pt_BR
In translations/CMakeLists.txt search for the lines
  add_subdirectory(cs)
  add_subdirectory(de)
  ...
and add there the line
  add_subdirectory(pt_BR)
Finally in translations/pt_BR/CMakeLists.txt replace in the first argument
of gettext_process_po_files the old language code by the new one, so
  gettext_process_po_files(fr ...
must become:
  gettext_process_po_files(pt_BR ...

After that (and only after all of the above has been done) the translation
to Brazilian Portuguese can be done (see "How to translate" below).  The
translations will be compiled and installed when you run (both for the
Qt-only and the KDE version):
  make
  sudo make install

Regenerating the existing translation source files:
---------------------------------------------------

When you add/change/remove translatable strings in the C++ code, you must
recreate the translation source files (translations/*/*.ts and
translations/*/*.po).  First build the application as described in
INSTALL (but don't do 'make install' yet), and then run
  make ts
in the build directory to generate an updated version of the .ts files.  Note
that running
  lupdate app.pro -ts ../translations/*/qtikz_*.ts
in the app directory is only sufficient if you have not changed the file
app/tikzcommands.xml (if you have changed this file, 'make ts' must be run
so that the translatable strings in this file are also added to the .ts files).

If you build the KDE version, the above steps must also be accomplished, but
additionally you must run
  ./extract_messages.sh
in the translations directory to get the strings that only appear in the KDE
version.  Note that this script depends on the extractrc script which is part
of the kdesdk-scripts (or under Ubuntu the pkg-kde-tools) package.

The translations/*/*.ts files can be edited using Qt Linguist, the
translations/*/*.po files can be edited using KDE's Lokalize.

After editing the translation source files, they will be compiled and installed
when you run (both for the Qt-only and the KDE version):
  make
  sudo make install

How to translate:
-----------------

In order to fully translate the Qt-only version, the translations/*/*.ts
files must be translated and translations must be added to
data/qtikz.desktop.template.  In order to fully translate the KDE version,
these translations must also be done, but additionally you must translate
the translations/*/*.po files and add the necessary translations to
data/ktikz.desktop.

A full translation consists of the following steps:
- The file translations/<languagecode>/qtikz_<languagecode>.ts is edited
  using Qt Linguist.
- The file translations/<languagecode>/ktikz.po is edited using KDE's
  Lokalize.
- In data/qtikz.desktop.template and data/ktikz.desktop (which you can edit
  in any text editor) the entries GenericName[<languagecode>] and
  Comment[<languagecode>] must be added for your language.
Of course <languagecode> must be replaced by the language code of your
language (e.g. fr for French, or pt_BR for Brazilian Portuguese).  If the
files for your language don't exist yet, then they must be created (see
"Adding a new language" above).  For example, to translate ktikz fully to
Brazilian Portuguese, you have to translate:
- translations/pt_BR/qtikz_pt_BR.ts
- translations/pt_BR/ktikz.po
- data/qtikz.desktop.template
- data/ktikz.desktop

After editing the translation source files, they will be compiled and installed
when you run (both for the Qt-only and the KDE version):
  make
  sudo make install
