KtikZ in Debian
---------------

The ktikz and qtikz packages both recommend other packages that provide
"standard" functionality for ktikz but it is possible to run the program
without these packages being installed.

ktikz recommended packages:
- poppler-utils: export as EPS functionality
- khelpcenter4: documentation browser (/usr/bin/khelpcenter)

qtikz recommended packages:
- poppler-utils: export as EPS functionality
- qt4-dev-tools: documentation browser (/usr/bin/assistant)
