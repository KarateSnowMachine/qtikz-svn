The Ubuntu/debian package infrastructure can be found in ./debian
In order to compile a releasable package, you need a pbuilder
environment. Please follow the Ubuntu packaging guide:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete#The Personal Builder: pbuilder

A debian package is created in two steps. The first step is to create
a source package which describes all changes relative to the release
tarball. Create a release tarball using:
make package

Untar this release tarball to /tmp and copy the debian directory
cp ktikz-VERSION.tar.gz /tmp
tar --directory /tmp -xf ktikz-VERSION.tar.gz
cp -aR debian /tmp/ktikz-VERSION/
cd /tmp/ktikz-VERSION

The next step is to create the source package
cd /tmp/ktikz-VERSION
debuild -S

Now you should have a .dsc file in /tmp. The next step is to compile
the binary package using pbuilder:
cd /tmp
pbuilder --build ktikz_VERSION.dsc

If the build finished successfully you should have the result in
/var/cache/pbuilder/result/ktikz_VERSION_ARCH.deb
